# Ticket PLAN4-23 â€” Operability & red-team documentation

- **Story Points:** 1
- **Depends on:** PLAN4-21, PLAN4-22

## Goal
Document runbooks, red-team scenarios, and mitigation guidance so operators can support the more dynamic Phase 4 personalization features.

## Context
Safety is a core principle. Comprehensive documentation ensures on-call engineers and PMs know how to respond to ambiguous prompts, regulated industries, or feature toggling needs.

## Requirements
1. Create `docs/operability/phase4-runbook.md` describing key workflows: enabling/disabling toggles, clearing caches, interpreting telemetry alerts.
2. Add a red-team appendix outlining at least five risky prompt scenarios (regulated industries, malicious content, contradictory requests) with mitigation steps.
3. Document circuits/caches introduced in PLAN4-22/13 and how to reset them without downtime.
4. Include escalation paths and SLA expectations for personalization outages.
5. Review the runbook with ops/PM stakeholders and capture sign-off notes in the doc.

## Implementation Steps
1. Gather context from previous phases and new features (toggles, cache, telemetry).
2. Draft the runbook with clear headings, step-by-step instructions, and checklists.
3. Append red-team scenarios with detection tips and fallback procedures.
4. Circulate the draft for feedback and integrate responses.

## Definition of Done
- Runbook document exists with operational procedures and red-team scenarios.
- Mitigation steps cover caches, toggles, and circuit breakers.
- Stakeholder sign-off recorded in the doc.
- Content aligns with Phase 4 safety principles.

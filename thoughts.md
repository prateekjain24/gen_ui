# Thoughts on the Canvas Project

Okay, Duck—picture this: product and go-to-market folks keep spinning up onboarding flows for every new customer scenario. Usually that means tons of Figma mocks, hand-offs to engineering, and, let’s be honest, a graveyard of stale Notion docs. Canvas changes that by letting them *talk* to an AI about what they need, and instantly seeing an interactive flow assembled for them.

Here’s what’s exciting (and real, no fluff):

- **Signals-first brain.** Every prompt goes through a classifier and signal extractor. That means “team of 40 on Slack + Linear with compliance hurdles” actually turns into structured knobs—team size, integrations, approval chains—that the UI can react to. No vague copy/paste chores.

- **LLM-generated experience, not just text.** The full plan—screens, fields, copy, CTAs—updates live based on those signals. If the model hears “audit logging,” the approvals toggle, checklist cadence, and helper text all shift together. It’s not just a single paragraph; the entire orchestration changes.

- **Human tuning built in.** Product folks can pop open the Customize drawer, tweak approval depth or tone, and the plan rehydrates instantly. Undo/Reset are there so experimentation doesn’t turn into chaos.

- **Telemetry and observability.** Every decision (signals applied, copy fallbacks, personalization confidence) gets logged. When something falls back to defaults, we know why, and can refine prompts or guardrails. It’s AI with accountability.

- **POC speed with production guardrails.** We leaned on LLMs for creativity but wrapped them in schemes (like response schemas and validation) so the output is consistent enough to hand to a front-end engineer—or even use directly in a dev-preview.

Bottom line: Canvas makes the conversation about “what onboarding flow do we need?” happen *inside* a working prototype. That shortens feedback loops, keeps product + sales aligned, and gives the team a living artifact instead of another deck. Pretty quacktastic, right?

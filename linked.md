I’ve been tinkering nights and weekends on a quick-and-dirty experiment called **Canvas**—and I’m genuinely excited about what it could unlock for product and go-to-market teams.

Here’s the itch I wanted to scratch: every time someone wants a fresh onboarding experience (“10-person team, uses Slack + Linear, needs approvals”) we spin up another Figma file, another spec doc, another round of hand-offs. Momentum dies. Canvas flips that playbook.

With one plain-English prompt, the AI:
- Understands the *signals* behind the request—team size, integrations, compliance needs.
- Generates an interactive flow on the spot (screens, copy, CTAs, toggles) that reflects those signals.
- Lets you tweak approvals or tone in a side drawer and watches the whole plan rehydrate in seconds.

The best part? Every decision is transparent. If Canvas falls back to default copy or dialed down approvals, you know exactly why—and you can fix it.

No, this isn’t polished production software (yet). It’s a scrappy learning project that had me deep in prompt engineering, schema validation, and telemetry so we can trust the AI’s output.

Why am I sharing? Because the faster we can go from idea → working onboarding flow, the more time teams can spend with customers instead of fiddling with artifacts. If you’ve felt that pain, I’d love your feedback—or even a simple “same here.”
